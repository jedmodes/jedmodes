This is the JED a2ps suite.  A2ps is a text-to-postscript converter.
It can pretty print sources in lots of programming languages through
the use of style sheets.  The home page is
(http://www.inf.enst.fr/~demaille/a2ps).

Files:
* README: this file
* a2ps.sl: a mode for editing a2ps style sheets.
* slang.ssh: an a2ps style sheet for pretty printing S-Lang source.
* slangtm.ssh: for pretty printing tm documentation.

Todo:
* Send this stuff to the a2ps maintainers.
* Function for pretty-printing a buffer from JED.
* Maybe switch to GNU enscript, which has an AWK-like stylesheet language
  that should even be able to prettify tm comments INSIDE the source.

How to use this:

Put slang.ssh and slangtm.ssh in the sheets directory, and add the lines

 slangtm: /*.tm/
 slang: /*.sl/

to sheet.map. To prettify a2ps.sl, simply type

 a2ps -o a2ps.ps a2ps.sl

To get pretty tm documentation, you need a tm file.  TM files for
JED should be in jed-source-dir/doc/tm/rtl, for slrn they are in
slrn-src-dir/doc/tm/slrnfuns.  For JMR modes, extract the tm yourself
with sl2tm (in the S-Lang package).


Notes: 
* If the printed output looks terrible, don't ask me - it looks
  great in gv.
