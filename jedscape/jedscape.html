<h2>install</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Get the <a href ="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~mbayer/tools/html2text.html">html2text
  </a> program or some other tool to convert html to text. I recommend html2text
  because it is smaller than lynx and the syntax highlighting of this mode
  assumes that headings start with an asterisk. The next version may use
  functions from <a href="http://jedmodes.sf.net/index.php?mode=outline">outline mode</a> to
  fold up sections under headings, or would that be too html2text specific?
  <li>Get view.sl, ishell.sl and any other required nonstandard modes from the
  <a href="http://jedmodes.sf.net">JMR</a>.  If string_nth_match 
  is not in strutils.sl yet, put it in your .jedrc:
  <pre><code>
  define string_nth_match()
  {
     variable pos, len;
     (pos, len) = string_match_nth(n);
     return substr(str, pos+1, len);
     string_get_last_match;
  }
    </code></pre>
  <li>Create a homepage with links to your html documentation.
</ul><h2>urls</h2>
Jedscape can only browse local files.  It also hands mailto: urls to
mail() and hands http: urls to browse_url().  It might be possible to
use wget to get a remote page and load that into jedscape, but since we
don't support frames and forms and don't cache files it would be a
rather worthless browser, and since I don't have a permanent connection
I prefer to use a real browser when online.
<h2>keybindings</h2>
The plan is to be as compatible with info as possible.  Set the variable
Jedscape_Emulation to change some things to emulate lynx, netscape or Emacs'
w3.
<h2>using jedscape with cgi programs</h2>
Jedscape has alpha support for running a program in /usr/lib/cgi-bin. It can
read manpages with <a href="http://www.actrix.gen.nz/users/michael">man2html</a>
and almost read info documentation with info2www.  The problem with info2www
is the way it parses arguments is incompatible with man2html. Info2www is
inferior to JED's info reader, and man2html is much faster than man, so we
choose to support man2html.
<h3>info2www</h3>
An URL may look like: ?(groff)What+Is+groff%3F
<p>
/usr/lib/info2www \(groff\)What\ Is \groff?
gives me the html documentation of the node what Is groff?
<p>
/usr/lib/info2www "(groff)What Is groff?" works too.
<p>
/usr/lib/info2www (groff)What Is groff? does not work, it says
Sorry! - Couldn't find target: "What+Is+groff?" in file "groff".
<H3>man2html</H3>
On the other hand, in man2html a link to xterm(1) looks like
<p>
man2html?xterm+1
<p>
which works if I run /usr/lib/cgi-bin/man2html xterm 1, but not if I try
man2html "xterm 1".  In a webserver they both work fine.  Apparently in a
webserver the arguments are passed in the environment, so
<p>
http://localhost/cgi-bin/man2html?xterm+1
<p>
would put 'xterm+1' in the environment variable QUERYSTRING, but I haven't
been able to get any cgi script working by setting environment variables.
<h4>using jedscape instead of man</h4>
Jedscape.sl with man2html is much faster than hyperman.sl with man, does not
open a separate buffer for each manpage, and looks better on big screens.
You may want to use it instead of hyperman.  You can use this function:
<pre><code>
  define unix_man() % manpage
  {
  !if (_NARGS) read_mini("man", "", get_word());
  variable page=();
  jedscape_get_url(sprintf("/cgi-bin/man2html?%s", page));
  }
  </code></pre>
If you need to have multiple manpage buffers open, or one manpage and a html
page, evalfile hyperman.sl to get it back.
<h2>todo</h2>
<ul>
  <li>support for embedding SLang code in html pages, maybe with
  <a href= "http://www.geocities.com/mmarko.geo/jeddoc/">jedasp.sl</a>
  <li>better emulations of other browsers
  <li>when a file is opened in JED, read it from the buffer instead of the file - would be great for
  previewing your HTML.
</ul>
<h2>news</h2>
Changes in 1.2:
<ul>
  <li>We now use shell_cmd_on_region in <a href="http://jedmodes.sf.net/index.php?mode=/ishell">ishell.sl</a> instead of
  process_region. This means that we can use links -dump to render the page
  (my version of links doesn't have an option to read from stdin). Links turns
  out to be faster than html2text (lynx and w3m are slow). But so far
  this mode has mostly been tested with html2text, so watch out for updates.
  <li>mousedrag hook is outsourced to mousedrag.sl
  <li>left clicking on a link shows the target in the minibuffer. Clicking again follows the link
  <li>browse_url.sl is outsourced, and is now maintained by G&uuml;nter Milde
  <li>fixed bug in marking of header-links (would lowercase the target, instead of the name)
  <li>in absence of header links, 'n' will now try to follow an ordinary 'next' link
  <li>screen is no longer redrawn before rendering the page
  <li>jedscape_mode_hook
  <li>bookmark function
  <li><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/pauljlucas/software/swish/">swish++</a>
  index lookup function
  <li>jedscape_lookup function. With the help_for_word_hook this provides on-line help for PHP and HTML
</ul>
