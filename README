Jedmodes README
===============

This are the source files of the CVS repository of the Jed Modes Repository,
a collection of S-Lang scripts (modes) contributed by Jed users.

Some of the modes are experimental (while others work stable for their 
authors for ages), so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Usage
-----

Generally: 
 
 * Place the files you want to use in the search path for jed library files
   (cf. Help>Describe_Function get_jed_library_path)

 * See the individual modes for detailled usage instructions.


The `libdir` and `make_ini` modes provide an jed extension framework. 

* The functions add_libdir(dir, initialize=1) and 
  append_libdir(dir, initialize=1) register a library dir for use by jed

  * Prepend|Append `path' to the library path
  * Set `Color_Scheme_Path', `Jed_Doc_Files',
    and `Jed_Highlight_Cache_Path'
  * Evaluate (if existent) the file `ini.sl` in this library
    to enable initialization (autoloads etc.). This is customizable by the
    optional second argument.

* The functions in `make_ini` can be used to create such an ini.sl file.
  They can also preparse SLang files and create dfa syntax tables.
