===============

a collection of S-Lang scripts (modes) contributed by Jed users.

Usage
-----
 
* Place the files you want to use in the search path for jed library files
  (cf. Help>Describe_Function get_jed_library_path)

* See the individual modes for detailled usage instructions.


The `libdir`_ and `make_ini`_ modes provide an jed extension framework. 

* The functions ``add_libdir(dir, initialize=1)`` and 
  ``append_libdir(dir, initialize=1)`` register a library dir for use by Jed

  * Prepend|Append ``path`` to the library path
  * Set ``Color_Scheme_Path``, ``Jed_Doc_Files``,
    and ``Jed_Highlight_Cache_Path``
  * Evaluate (if existent) the file ``ini.sl`` in this directory
    to enable initialization (autoloads etc.). This is customizable by the
    optional second argument.

* The functions in `make_ini`_ can be used to create such an ini.sl file.
  They can also preparse SLang files and create dfa syntax tables.
